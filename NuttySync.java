 * Overview: Used as a backup tool, NuttySync will sync one directory (source or master) and sub folders to
 * another directory (destination or copy). Any files not in destination but in source will be moved to a dump
 * folder. In order to achieve faster performance in subsequence runs, a file will be generated that lists all
 * items in the directory. This file will be used as an alternative to reading in each item in destination. *
