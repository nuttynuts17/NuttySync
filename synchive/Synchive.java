/** Created by Tony Hsu. Free to use with credit. Overview: Used as a backup
 * tool, NuttySync will sync one directory (source or master) and sub folders to
 * another directory (destination or backup). Any files not in destination but
 * in source will be moved to a dump folder. In order to achieve faster
 * performance in subsequent runs, a file will be generated that lists all items
 * in the directory. This file will be used as an alternative to reading in each
 * item in destination. */
